# Cell One status (for Jason)

Snapshot of **what is on `main` after this merge**. Not a live-box report.
Not a release. Workspace crates are `0.1.0` (crate version, not crates.io).

Read with [`../README.md`](../README.md) → [`OPERATOR-DAY.md`](OPERATOR-DAY.md)
→ [`GATE-90.md`](GATE-90.md). Parked boxes: [`DAY90-PLUS.md`](DAY90-PLUS.md).

## On `main` (PR #1–#14 plus this slice)

Day 0–90 factory is merged. Horizon / Research / Sanctum on separate lanes.
Sacred dual-layer KEEP: Cyera CI and Rust classroom stay out of the estate.
Sanctum is first-class and is not Cyera.

Operator entrypoint is local `make gate-90`. Hosted Actions stays one
`pull_request` job: `cargo check --workspace --locked`. Do not put
`cargo test` or `make gate-90` on Actions.

## As of #14 (clean hunts)

#14 locked plan exits, dry-run refuse writes, and curator clap vs
`refuse:curator`. No new product bug on those three paths.

## Bug fix this slice

| What was broken | What it does now |
| --- | --- |
| `convey sync` slim-parsed `placement-actual.json` through `canonical_host_class`, which rewrote unknown / SKU `host_class` (example: `rtx-5090`) to `any`. A tampered lease could seed a portable hop. | Unknown host class is `refuse:bad-host-class`. No hop files written. Aliases (`rtx_consumer`, `nvidia-rental`, case/underscore) still round-trip to the locked names. Overlay files with `locked: []` still cannot drop Cyera CI / Rust classroom. |

## Bug fixes on #10–#13 (plain English)

| PR | What was broken | What it does now |
| --- | --- |
| #10 | After a placement lease expired, `expire --forget` dropped the row. The next `apply` treated that as drift and demanded `--force`. | Same desired estate restamps the lease (`lease-refresh`). No `--force`. Isolated TTL e2e on `ttl-short.yaml`. |
| #11 | Overlay e2e was missing. Easy to believe `locked: []` in a sacred file would drop Cyera CI / Rust classroom. | Isolated sacred overlay e2e: omit-locked file still refuses those two on convey. `lab-notebook` refuses only with the overlay installed. |
| #12 | `convey expire --forget` deleted hop *declarations* with the leases. The next `call` said `refuse:no-lease`. | Forget keeps the hop decl. `call` restamps (`lease-refresh`), same idea as #10. Expired still refuses until forget. |
| #13 | `restore` treated empty/missing backup `sacred_ids` as “matches anything” and could write files. | Empty set is `refuse:sacred-mismatch`. Dry-run and live restore both write nothing. |

## Known-good local commands

Hosted CI is compile-only. These stay on the box:

```bash
make gate-90          # smoke + day90 + doctor --strict + checklist (local)
make smoke            # doctor + fixtures-check + operator-day + cargo test + day90
make day90            # isolated operator loop
make feed-loop        # scrubbed trace → pack → propose → accept (not in smoke)
make fixtures-check   # fixture files only
make doctor-strict    # pre-merge extras
make check            # cargo check --workspace --locked (same as Actions)
estate help           # Day-90 topics
```

`make gate-90` does not invoke `gh` or GitHub Actions.

Isolated loops without live boxes:

- Dual-layer-demo: `crates/estate-control/tests/day90_e2e.rs`
- Two dry-runs + backup/restore: `tests/day90_props.rs`
- Short TTL: `examples/fixtures/ttl-short.yaml` + `tests/day90_ttl.rs`
- Sacred overlay: `sacred-omit-locked.yaml` + `tests/day90_sacred.rs`
- Hop TTL: `tests/day90_hop.rs`
- Contracts: `tests/day90_contracts.rs` / `tests/day90_plan.rs`
- Feed: [`FEED-LOOP.md`](FEED-LOOP.md)

Cloud-agent stays declared, not spawned. Feed never auto-promotes.
`estate.yaml` is never rewritten by rematerialize.

## Still parked (not green)

| Item | State |
| --- | --- |
| Live Mac MLX | Probe path only. No Mac attached. |
| Live consumer / rented GPU | Same specialist protocol. Not required for gates. |
| Cloud-agent spawn | Declared only. Floor does not spawn. |
| Auto-promote / curator UI | Locked off / not built. Jason pastes pack ids. |
| Convey hop transport | Lease-bound mesh, not a gateway. |
| vLLM / TRT | Catalog cards until you verify. |
| Actions expansion | Compile-only unless you expand it. |

## Rails that still hold

GitHub is the only source of truth. No Origin. No auto-promote. Cloud
never spawned. Pause-safe disk. Not Dual PE, not a studio, not an
AI-gateway product. `examples/estate.yaml` hash stays
`sha256:dcd7164f04c83f514185e77d2d4f6c23cae6dbb27a9b5da96a28ba1f3c724930`.
