# Train/enrich prepare

Operator page for the first durable train/enrich beachhead. Words: [`UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md`](UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md). Product story: [`NORTH-STAR.md`](NORTH-STAR.md). Walks: [`operator-enrich-journeys.md`](operator-enrich-journeys.md).

`estate enrich prepare` writes artifacts for a purpose-built SLM. It does not train. It does not POST. It does not rewrite `estate.yaml`. Promote stays off.

## What exists today

| Piece | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `TrainEnrichDriver` | Data-plane trait in `model-estate`. `id()`, `prepare(job)`, catalog `status` / `probe`. |
| `ollama-modelfile` | Integration. Writes a Modelfile (`FROM` + `SYSTEM`), `PREPARE.md`, and `NEXT.md` with the exact `ollama create` line. Does not shell out. |
| `external-manifest` | Portable JSON and YAML. Base model ref, purpose, host class affinity, dataset path hints from the pack `source_paths`. No vendor lock. `NEXT.md` names the files to hand off. |
| `NEXT.md` | Operator card in the output directory. Artifact paths, the handoff command, the `import-prepared` line, and the fail-closed reminders. |
| `estate enrich drivers` | Prints the catalog. `live=false`. A probe here does not train. |
| `estate enrich prepare --all-drivers` | One call. Each registered card writes a sibling directory. A refuse writes none of them. |
| `estate enrich list` | Reads `{state_dir}/enrich/{pack}/{driver}/prepare.json`. Prints pack, driver, job, tag, and out path. Does not create the directory. |
| `estate enrich import-prepared` | Checks `prepare.json` plus the tag and file you created outside the factory. Writes `binding-proposal.json` and `binding-proposal.md` for the existing `local_slm` seat. Does not apply. |
| `estate help enrich` | Same page as `estate help train`. |
| `make enrich-prepare` | Opt-in fixture walk. Not in `make smoke`, `make gate-90`, or GitHub Actions. |

Job field: `enrich` (default) or `train`. The field is a label on the artifact. Both jobs only prepare.

Default output is `.cell/enrich/{pack_id}/{driver}/`. Pass `--out` to write somewhere else, including `packs/prepared/`. Layout: [`cell-layout.md`](cell-layout.md). Schema: [`../schema/train-enrich.v0.json`](../schema/train-enrich.v0.json) (`cell-one.enrich-prepare.v0`).

## Facilitated vs invented

Ollama already creates a model from a Modelfile. This factory writes that file and the next command. It does not invent a local inference server and it does not invent a GPU training stack.

A full LoRA / SFT / DPO loop, a dataset downloader, and a GPU scheduler stay out of this beachhead.

```bash
estate enrich prepare \
  --estate examples/estate.yaml \
  --pack examples/fixtures/specialist-overnight.pack.json \
  --all-drivers \
  --state-dir .cell

estate enrich list --state-dir .cell
```

`list` prints one row per prepared driver. A missing `.cell/enrich` is `refuse:enrich-index`. The command does not create that directory.

`NEXT.md` for `ollama-modelfile` prints the create line with the Modelfile path. Run that on the seated host. This factory does not run it.

```bash
ollama create cell-enrich-overnight-traces -f .cell/enrich/overnight-traces/ollama-modelfile/Modelfile
```

The local tag is `cell-enrich-{pack_id}`. `FROM` is the portable base ref (`model_hint`, or `local_slm` when the pack leaves the hint empty). The factory does not pull weights.

After that model exists, record the join. The tag must match. `--path` must be a file.

```bash
estate enrich import-prepared \
  --estate examples/estate.yaml \
  --prepared .cell/enrich/overnight-traces/ollama-modelfile \
  --tag cell-enrich-overnight-traces \
  --path .cell/enrich/overnight-traces/ollama-modelfile/Modelfile
```

That writes `binding-proposal.json` and `binding-proposal.md` in the prepared directory. The snippet replaces the existing `local_slm` binding and keeps the id. `params.model` is the tag. Other params on that binding are copied. Paste it into the estate file you apply (leave the hash-locked example on `main` alone), then:

```bash
estate plan --estate <your-estate.yaml>
estate apply --estate <your-estate.yaml> --require-plan
```

`import-prepared` does not run those commands. `auto_apply`, `promoted`, and `estate_rewritten` stay false. A catalog file is not written.

## Swap a driver

```bash
estate enrich prepare \
  --pack examples/fixtures/specialist-overnight.pack.json \
  --driver external-manifest \
  --out target/enrich-manifest
```

`manifest.json` and `manifest.yaml` are the market-shift hatch. A later trainer reads `base_model`, `purpose`, `host_class_affinity`, and `dataset_paths`. Cell One does not call that trainer. When weights come back, load them on the seated runtime as `cell-enrich-{pack_id}` and point `import-prepared --path` at that file.

## Add a third entrant

1. Implement `TrainEnrichDriver` in `model-estate` (a sibling of the two drivers).
2. Add one `RegisteredDriver` card in `crates/model-estate/src/train_enrich.rs`.
3. Leave floor-supervisor and `estate-control` dispatch alone. They pass the driver id through.

`estate enrich drivers` prints the new card. No estate file change is required to register it.

## Refuse

Prepare loads the estate the same way pack import does: parsed, then the enrich gates, before the Cell One equal-class shape check. A local-only estate can still hit `refuse:frontier-invent`.

| Condition | Code |
| --- | --- |
| Pack id or path is missing | `refuse:missing-pack` |
| Curator is not `jason`, or the estate curator is not `jason` | `refuse:curator` |
| Sacred token in the pack note, system text, or paths | `refuse:sacred` |
| Hardware SKU in a model id or path | `refuse:sku-banned` or `refuse:model-hint` / `refuse:source-path` |
| Pack tags `frontier` and the estate has no frontier binding | `refuse:frontier-invent` |
| Unknown driver id | `refuse:driver` |
| `--driver` and `--all-drivers` together | `refuse:driver` |
| Job is not `train` or `enrich` | `refuse:job` |
| `{state_dir}/enrich` is missing on list | `refuse:enrich-index` |
| `prepare.json` missing, unreadable, or flagged promoted | `refuse:missing-prepare`, `refuse:prepare-unreadable`, `refuse:prepared` |
| Tag is not `cell-enrich-{pack_id}` | `refuse:tag` |
| Operator path is missing or not a file | `refuse:path` |
| Estate has no `local_slm` seat | `refuse:binding` |

Those prepare stops happen before the output directory is created. `--all-drivers` stages every card first, so one refuse leaves no sibling directory from that call. List does not create `.cell/enrich`. Import writes the proposal only after the gates pass.

## Opt-in walk

```bash
make enrich-prepare
```

Uses `examples/fixtures/specialist-overnight.pack.json`. Writes both drivers under `target/enrich-prepare-cell`, then `estate enrich prepare --all-drivers`, `estate enrich list`, and `estate enrich import-prepared` on a throwaway state directory. Asserts a Modelfile, an external manifest, `NEXT.md`, the index, and a binding proposal. A wrong tag refuses before `binding-proposal.json` exists. Leaves `examples/estate.yaml` unchanged. Does not need an Ollama binary. The script prints `SKIP live train` because this walk is not a train.

`make real-world` points here and does not run a train. See [`OPERATOR-DAY.md`](OPERATOR-DAY.md).

`READY_FOR_LIVE_TEST`: no.
